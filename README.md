# While Building the App!

1. ## How much logic did I offloaded out of the UI components?

- Created `SongsCard` and `GenreCard`, mapped the data out of array/collection and passing down the specific data as prop for a particular card
- There is Case while making Playlists/Songs Rows code is repetative,so followed `DRY` (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principal
  so offload the data into `PlaylistRow` and passed the props to this component making `PlayLists` Component More Readable, Modular and Reusable.
- Instead of repeating the Fixed component (Header, Sidebar, Footer) for each Page
  Just offloaded the Changing part i.e. MainComp and passed the Whole Data as special `{Children} Prop` making use of `Higher Order Component (HOC) Pattern`
- For Footer made 3 sections
  1. Song details
  2. Player with controls and
  3. Volume and extra options

2. ## How did I structured my app?

- While Structuring App Code is look-like chaos and unmodular at first so Seperated out the layout Component and then `Compose` them into Single `Home` Page Component.

Following tree Summerizes the Structure of APP

3. ## What I did it made the use of Redux as simple as possible?

- Started with spotify Auth, thought of making authSlice but later dropped and stored it in `window.localstorage`

  Reasons
  - There is no option for signup or custom login page it's done by Spotify Auth API under the hood
  - so no need to make another slice and crowding the store for single token to use over the app lifecycle
- Async calls using thunk and just added loading as boolean flag to signal data is fetched or in pending/rejected state
